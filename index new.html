                <p>Raised by American immigrants, the neighborhood at the border of Frederiksberg was an idyllic yet isolating place during the 1960s and 1970s. A desire for connection resonated with the music. First through a dusty upright, a Williams, 1905 vintage, a gift from departing neighbors, and later through the energy of teenage bands in the concrete sprawl of Danish suburbia. Doing the chores of an apprentice in a music store in the 1980s not only provided a means of survival but also meant access to all the sonic storytelling tools of the time. Delving deeper, an opening came up at a startup, navigating the complex business of audio post-production on a dilapidated Fairlight II. Thus creating a path to a new world in California where cutting edge sound design was the norm of the day. Later the lure of the moving image proved so strong it became a serious side addiction, working closely with news reporters abroad on documentary projects that would open viewers minds to the extremes of our human tapestry. It has been a privilege to collaborate with global talents, witnessing firsthand the magic that unfolds when diverse skills converge. While the luxury of leisure has allowed our family to grow, the hopes of future generations fan the flames of imagination, as we discover entirely different ways to express our needs and desires, at speeds that exceeds even the blink of an eye. Filmmaking, a blend of expertise, serendipity, and sheer dedication, is by all means a continuous learning journey.  </p>
